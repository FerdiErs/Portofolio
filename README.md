# Portfolio Description: Data Analyst/Data Scientist

Welcome to my data-driven world, where I weave stories from raw data and unlock insights that empower decision-making. As a seasoned Data Analyst/Data Scientist, I'm thrilled to present a selection of my projects that showcase my ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. Through a fusion of technical expertise, analytical thinking, and a dash of creativity, I've crafted solutions that drive value across various domains.

# 1. Sleep Health Analysis:
Improving the health of workers in the industry requires understanding the impact of sleep. Utilizing Seaborn for data visualization and creating a dashboard will enable stakeholders to gain a better understanding of the data. Ultimately, this analysis will lead to a conclusive understanding of how sleep affects health and productivity.

# 2. Data Science Salary Prediction:
Developed a machine learning program to provide salary predictions for data science job positions. It uses historical salary data from the years 2020 to 2022 as a training dataset to learn patterns and associations between salary and other variables.

# 3. Customers Churn Prediction:
A sophisticated deep learning model was developed to predict customer churn, utilizing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as the architectural backbone, along with the Functional API model. The model's training was grounded on comprehensive historical customer churn data, yielding an impressive accuracy score of 92%.

# 4. Car or Bike Image Classification:
An advanced Image Classification model was developed using Deep Learning to accurately discern between images of cars and bikes. The model employed the renowned Xception architecture, resulting in an impressive accuracy score of 99%, a testament to its exceptional performance in this classification task.

# 5. Danamon Mobile Banking Application Reviews: 
A sophisticated Sentiment Analysis and Aspect Categorization system was made to analyze user reviews of the Danamon Mobile Banking Application. The project harnessed the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to gauge sentiment and categorize reviews based on sentiment analysis. Through the ingenious fusion of NLTK for text preprocessing, Scikit-learn for sentiment analysis, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for aspect categorization, the system achieved remarkable precision.
